# Working with Directives in GraphQL Gen

In GraphQL, **directives** are annotations that add extra metadata or behavior to your schema definitions and operations. They are prefixed with `@` and can optionally include arguments.

GraphQL Gen fully supports parsing and representing directives in your schema, preserving them in the generated AST. This enables plugins to interpret and generate custom logic based on directives‚Äîfor example, to enforce authentication, manage deprecation, or implement validation rules.

## üß† What Are Directives?

A directive modifies how a part of your schema or query should be handled. They are commonly used for:

- üîê **Authorization**: e.g., `@auth(requires: USER)`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecation**: e.g., `@deprecated(reason: "Use fullName.")`
- üè∑Ô∏è **Custom Metadata**: e.g., `@id` to mark a field as a primary identifier

They can be attached to types, fields, input values, interfaces, and more.

```graphql
type User @auth(requires: USER) {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use `fullName`.")
}
```

## üõ† How Directives Work in GraphQL Gen

When GraphQL Gen parses your schema, each directive is captured and stored as part of the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). You can access directives from within plugins to inform custom generation behavior.

Each directive is represented as a Directive object in the AST, structured as follows:

### `Directive` object structure:

| Field       | Type       | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | string     | The name of the directive (e.g., "auth")                                   |
| `arguments` | Argument[] | A list of name-value pairs passed to the directive                         |
| `location`  | string     | Where in the schema the directive appears (e.g., OBJECT, FIELD_DEFINITION) |

### `Argument` object structure:

| Field   | Type   | Description               |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `name`  | string | The name of the argument  |
| `value` | string | The value of the argument |

<Alert type="info" title="Note">
  üß© Directives are passed to plugins as-is, so plugins can apply their own
  logic based on the directive metadata.
</Alert>

## ‚úÖ Supported Usage Examples

GraphQL Gen supports common directive use cases out-of-the-box:

```graphql
type Post @auth(requires: ADMIN) {
  id: ID! @id
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type User {
  name: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use `fullName` instead.")
}
```

These directives are parsed and made available in the AST, allowing plugins to generate specific logic (e.g., adding guards to protected fields).

## üöß Limitations (For Now)

While GraphQL Gen supports simple directive structures, the following are not yet supported:

- **Nested directive arguments**

```graphql
@auth(requires: USER, permissions: { create: true, read: false })
```

- **List of complex values**

```graphql
@auth(requires: USER, permissions: [ { create: true }, { read: false } ])
```
