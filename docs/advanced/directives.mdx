# Directives

A directive is an identifier preceded by a @ character, optionally followed by a list of named arguments, which can appear after almost any form of syntax in the GraphQL query or schema languages.

GraphQL Gen supports parsing directives such as:

```graphql
type Foo @auth(requires: USER) {
  field: String!
}

type Bar {
  field: String! @auth(requires: USER)
}

type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use `fullName`.")
}
```

Directives are used to provide additional metadata about the schema or the fields. They can be used for various purposes, such as authentication, deprecation, or custom validation.

In GraphQL Gen, directives are represented as a list of `Directive` objects. Each `Directive` object contains the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the directive (e.g., `@auth`, `@deprecated`).
- `arguments`: A list of `Argument` objects representing the arguments passed to the directive. Each `Argument` object contains the following properties:
  - `name`: The name of the argument (e.g., `requires`, `reason`).
  - `value`: The value of the argument (e.g., `USER`, `"Use 'fullName'."`).
- `location`: The location of the directive in the schema (e.g., `FIELD_DEFINITION`, `OBJECT`).

## Example

```graphql
type User @auth(requires: USER) {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use `fullName`.")
}
```

## Things not supported yet

- Directives with nested arguments (e.g., `@auth(requires: USER, permissions: { create: true, read: false })`).
- Directives with complex values (e.g., `@auth(requires: USER, permissions: [ { create: true }, { read: false } ])`).
