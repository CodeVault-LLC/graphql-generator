# Plugin Overview

<Alert type="caution" title="Caution">
  🚧 GraphQL Gen’s plugin system is still evolving. While the interface is
  relatively stable, breaking changes may still occur in early versions. Make
  sure to pin plugin versions accordingly.
</Alert>

GraphQL Gen is designed to be lightweight and unopinionated. That’s why it doesn’t generate code out-of-the-box. Instead, it relies on **plugins** to transform the parsed GraphQL schema (in Rust AST form) into usable client or server code.

Plugins are responsible for bridging the gap between your GraphQL API and your application code—whether that's TypeScript, Rust, Go, or anything else.

## 🔍 What Does a Plugin Do?

Each plugin receives the parsed AST generated by GraphQL Gen and outputs code in your preferred format or for your specific runtime.

For example, the `apollo` plugin takes your schema and GraphQL operations and generates type-safe code for Apollo Client in a Node.js environment.
