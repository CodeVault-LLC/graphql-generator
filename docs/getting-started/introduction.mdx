# Welcome to GraphQL Gen

**GraphQL Gen** is a lightweight, plugin-based code generation tool designed to convert your GraphQL schema into a Rust-compatible Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This AST acts as a foundation for generating type-safe code in various environments.

The core philosophy of GraphQL Gen is **modularity**. The core library only parses the schema‚Äîit does not generate any code by itself. To generate code, you‚Äôll need to install a plugin. Plugins handle transforming the parsed AST into client or server code tailored to your stack (e.g., Apollo Client for Node.js, or other platforms in the future like Rust or Golang).

## How It Works

Here‚Äôs a high-level look at the process:

1. **Define Your Schema**

Write your schema using SDL (Schema Definition Language), or point to a GraphQL introspection endpoint.

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User
}
```

2. Configure GraphQL Gen

Create a configuration file (graphql-gen.json) that tells GraphQL Gen where to find your schema, where to output generated files, and which plugin to use.

  The configuration system is still evolving. Expect changes in the structure
  and behavior of plugins in future versions.
</Alert>

```json
{
  "schema": "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
  "output": "./src/__generated__/",
  "plugin": "apollo"
}
```

3. Generate Code

Run the GraphQL Gen CLI to generate type-safe code based on your schema and operations.

```bash
graphql-gen
```

And that's it! You‚Äôll now have a set of generated files tailored to your chosen plugin, ready to use in your application.
