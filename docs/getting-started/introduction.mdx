GraphQL Code Generator is an open-source, automated tool that simplifies the process of generating code from GraphQL schemas and operations. It allows developers to create type-safe code, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving the overall developer experience.

GraphQL Code Generator is written in GoLang for performance and efficiency. It is designed to work seamlessly with various GraphQL clients, including Apollo Client, Relay, and urql, among others. The tool can generate TypeScript types, React hooks, and even full-fledged components based on your GraphQL schema and queries.

## Understanding the simplified process

Here is the basic process of how GraphQL Code Generator works:

<Alert type="note" title="Recommendation">
  We suggest using a hosted GraphQL API for the best experience. We prioritize
  hosted introspection files over local files. Although it is still possible to
  use local files, but be aware that the process may be more complex and less
  efficient.

1. **Schema Definition**: You define your GraphQL schema using SDL (Schema Definition Language) or introspection. This schema serves as the foundation for generating code.

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}
```

2. **Operations**: You write GraphQL operations (queries, mutations, and subscriptions) that you want to generate code for. These operations can be defined in separate files or inline within your components.

```graphql
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

3. **Configuration**: You create a configuration file (usually `graphql-generator.conf.json`) that specifies the schema, operations, and desired output format. This file allows you to customize the code generation process according to your needs.

```json
{
  "schema": "http://localhost:3000/graphql",
  "output": {
    "path": "output",
    "filenames": {
      "types": "gpl.d.ts",
      "main": "gpl.ts"
    }
  },
  "language": "typescript",
  "languages": [
    { "name": "typescript", "entrypoint": "languages/typescript/main.so" }
  ]
}
```

4. **Code Generation**: You run the GraphQL Code Generator command, which reads the schema and operations, processes them according to the configuration, and generates the desired code. The generated code can include TypeScript types, React hooks, and more.

```bash
graphql-codegen --config graphql-generator.conf.json
```

5. **Integration**: You can integrate the generated code into your application. This may involve importing the generated types and hooks into your components, allowing you to use them seamlessly.

```typescript
import { useGetUserQuery } from "./output/gpl";

const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useGetUserQuery({
    variables: { id: userId },
  });

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.user.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

6. **Development**: As you develop your application, you can continue to add new operations and update your schema. The GraphQL Code Generator can be run again to regenerate the code, ensuring that it stays in sync with your GraphQL API.
